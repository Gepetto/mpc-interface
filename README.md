# MPC interface


This package provides a structure to formulate QP based MPC problems with any linear dynamics, cost functions and constraint.
All required QP matrices are generated automatically with the structure considered in [qpsolvers](https://scaron.info/doc/qpsolvers/).

This code is mainly based on python, the c++ is a work in progress which does not work yet.
